1. Product Overview
SignSense is an innovative system designed to facilitate communication between the hearing and Deaf communities by providing real-time sign language recognition. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and on-device processing capabilities, SignSense aims to make communication more accessible and inclusive in various environments.
The system takes video input of sign language, processes it to extract key features, and uses a trained model to identify the corresponding sign word. This allows for instant translation of sign language into text.
2. Problem Solved
Communication barriers exist between individuals who use sign language and those who do not. Existing solutions are often cumbersome, require specialized hardware, or are not suitable for real-time interaction. SignSense addresses this by providing a portable, real-time sign language recognition capability that can be integrated into everyday devices.
3. Key Features
Real-time Recognition: Processes video streams to recognize sign language in real-time.
Keypoint-based Analysis: Utilizes MediaPipe to extract robust keypoint data from hands, pose, and face, making the system less sensitive to variations in lighting and background.
On-Device Inference: Employs a TensorFlow Lite model optimized for efficient execution on mobile and edge devices, ensuring privacy and responsiveness.
Extensive Vocabulary: Trained on the WLASL (With Large-scale American Sign Language) dataset, supporting a large vocabulary of sign words.
Android Integration Ready: Designed with mobile deployment in mind, providing a TFLite model and guidance for Android application development.
4. Technology Stack
Data Source: WLASL-processed dataset (Kaggle)
Keypoint Extraction: Google MediaPipe (Holistic model)
Data Processing: NumPy, scikit-learn
Model Development & Training: TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM-based model)
Model Conversion: TensorFlow Lite Converter
Development Environment: Google Colab
Target Deployment: Android (conceptual integration guidance provided)
5. Development Process
The development followed a structured machine learning pipeline:
Dataset Acquisition: Downloaded the WLASL-processed dataset from Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing: Processed raw video files to extract MediaPipe keypoints for each sign instance. Keypoints were saved in a structured format.
Data Preparation: Loaded extracted keypoints, padded sequences to a uniform length, and split data into training and testing sets. Labels were one-hot encoded.
Model Definition & Training: Defined and trained a neural network model (initially LSTM, with attempts to improve stability). The model learns to map sequences of keypoints to sign language classes.
Model Conversion: Converted the trained TensorFlow model to the TensorFlow Lite format, optimizing it for mobile and edge device inference.
Model Testing: Tested the TFLite model in the development environment using sample data to verify functionality.
Deployment Guidance: Provided conceptual guidance on integrating the TFLite model and keypoint extraction into an Android application for real-time use.
Action List Generation: Generated a list of supported sign words in a format suitable for direct use in Android code for mapping model outputs to labels.
6. Potential Impact
SignSense has the potential to significantly improve communication accessibility:
Enhanced Communication: Enables more fluid and independent communication for Deaf individuals interacting with hearing individuals.
Educational Tool: Can be used as a learning aid for individuals learning sign language.
Accessibility in Public Spaces: Integration into public displays or service points could make these areas more accessible.
Assistive Technology: Can serve as a core component in broader assistive technology solutions.
7. Future Enhancements
Improved Model Architecture: Explore more advanced models (e.g., Transformers) for potentially higher accuracy and robustness.
Larger Dataset Training: Train on larger and more diverse sign language datasets.
Support for Multiple Sign Languages: Expand the system to recognize sign languages other than ASL.
Real-time Android Application: Develop a full-fledged Android application demonstrating real-time recognition.
Quantization: Further optimize the TFLite model using quantization for smaller size and faster inference.
Feedback Mechanisms: Implement features for users to provide feedback on recognition accuracy to improve the system over time.

This document summarizes the development of the core SignSense recognition engine. The process has focused on building a robust keypoint extraction and inference pipeline suitable for real-time application on mobile devices.
